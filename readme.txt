The dataset includes 200 samples and 9 variables.
The predictor variables related to the concrete constituents are the quantities of cement, fly ash, nanosilica, mineral filler, natural fine aggregate, natural coarse aggregate, and rubber aggregate. The curing age is the final predictor variable.
It is noted that rubber particles are used to replate the fine aggregate of the concrete mix.
The predicted variable is the compressive strength of the roller compacted concrete sample.
